In Ansible, the typical file structure for organizing your playbooks, inventory files, and other related files is as follows:


ansible/
├── hosts
├── playbooks/
│   ├── playbook1.yml
│   ├── playbook2.yml
│   └── ...
├── roles/
│   ├── role1/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   │   └── main.yml
│   │   ├── files/
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── vars/
│   │   │   └── main.yml
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── role2/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── files/
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── vars/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...

Here's a breakdown of the files and directories in this structure:

hosts: The inventory file that lists the hosts or machines you want to manage.

playbooks/: A directory where you store your playbooks. Each playbook is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks to be executed on the target hosts.

playbooks/playbook1.yml, playbooks/playbook2.yml, etc.: Individual playbooks that define the tasks to be executed.

roles/: A directory where you organize your Ansible roles. A role is a reusable collection of tasks, variables, templates, and files that can be used across multiple playbooks.

# docker images is prefixed in this format: ${PROJECT_NAME}-${docker_container_name}-${docker instance}
docker-ubuntu-slave1-1

Make sure the docker files are in the same network

# docker network is prefixed in this format: ${PROJECT_NAME}${%s}
$ docker network inspect docker_my_network
